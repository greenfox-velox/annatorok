# Imagine you are creating a game where the user has to guess the correct number. But there is a limit of how many guesses the user can do.
#
# If the user tries to guess more than the limit the function show throw an error
# If the user guess wrong it should lose a life and return false (if you guess correctly you shouldn't remove a life)
# If the user guess right it should return true
# Can you finish the game so all the rules are met?
